**Skills4Antigravity** is the official community toolkit designed **specifically for Google Antigravity**. It provides a collection of native, executable workflows that unlock the full potential of your agent.

By using these workflows, you transform Google Antigravity from a chat assistant into a **production-class engineer**.

## ✨ Why use this with Google Antigravity?

Antigravity's "Agentic Mode" is powerful. This toolkit gives it the **structured plans** it needs to:

* Build complex apps without getting lost.
* Connect to external tools via MCP.
* Audit and refactor code like a senior dev.

## ✨ What's Inside?

| Category | Workflow | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🎨 **Design** | `frontend-design` | Create distinctive, award-winning UI designs. No "AI Slop". |
| 🛠️ **Build** | `mcp-builder` | Build robust **MCP Servers** (TypeScript/Python) to connect data. |
| 🧪 **Test** | `webapp-testing` | Auto-test your localhost apps with **Playwright**. |
| 🏗️ **Create** | `web-artifacts-builder` | Generate complex, multi-file **React Artifacts**. |
| 🛡️ **Secure** | `security-audit` | Scan your code for vulnerabilities and secrets. |
| 🧹 **Refactor** | `code-refactor` | Clean up technical debt safely and efficiently. |
| ✅ **Setup** | `setup-check` | Verify your environment (Node, Python, Git). |
| 🤖 **Orchestrate** | `parallel-orchestrator` | **New!** Deploy a multi-agent team in one session. |
