# Frontend Design Workflow

This workflow guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## 1. Design Thinking

**Before coding**, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## 2. Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. USe CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Focus on high-impact moments (staggered reveals).
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere. Add contextual effects, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, custom cursors.

**NEVER** use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families, cliched color schemes (purple gradients), or cookie-cutter layouts.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code. Minimalist designs need restraint and precision.

## 3. Implementation

Implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional.
- Visually striking and memorable.
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view.
- Meticulously refined.

## 4. Verification

Before finalizing, verify:

- **Responsive**: Does it stack correctly on mobile? (Resize window to 375px).
- **Accessibility**: logical heading structure? Contrast ratio > 4.5:1? All interactables focusable?
- **Console**: No red errors in the browser console.

Remember: Antigravity is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back.
