# Frontend Design Workflow

## 1. Design Thinking

**Before coding**, define the aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme (Minimalist, Maximalist, Retro, Industrial, etc.).
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements.
- **Differentiation**: What makes this unforgettable?

## 2. Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: choice distinctive fonts. Avoid generic Inter/Arial.
- **Color**: Commit to a cohesive palette. Use CSS variables.
- **Motion**: Use staggered reveals, scroll triggers, and micro-interactions.
- **Composition**: Use unexpected layouts, asymmetry, or grid-breaking elements.
- **Details**: Add noise, gradients, shadows, or custom cursors.

## 3. Implementation

- Implementing working code (HTML/CSS/JS or React).
- Ensure it is production-grade and functional.
- **NO GENERIC AI AESTHETICS** (No purple gradients on white, no cookie-cutter layouts).
